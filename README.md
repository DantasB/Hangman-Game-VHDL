# Hangman Game

A simple Hangman Game constructed using VHDL made by Bruno Dantas, Guilherme Bergman and Jo√£o Ricardo.

The Hangman Game is a simple guessing game that one player think in a word, phrase or sentence and the others try to guess it by suggesting letters whith a certain number of guesses.



## Important 
This code was a College work that had some requirements:
- The Game needed to show the hide word using "* or -".
- If the person guessed the wrong word, the game needed to show the number of errors.
- The Game needed to have a maximum number of tries (Like the real game).

## Code
The professor gave us some developed codes that would help us on understand how to lcd display worked and how to write the words in there. Below are these codes:
- [kb_code.vhd](kbcode.vhd)
- [ps2_rx.vhd](ps2_rx.vhd)
- [fifo.vhd](fifo.vhd)
